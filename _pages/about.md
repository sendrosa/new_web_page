Born in Drama, studied as an Electrical and Computer Engineer (ECE) at the Democritus University of Thrace (DUTH), graduating in 2020. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the department of ECE of DUTH, in the research area “Efficient computations in Blockchain infrastructure environment”, under the advisory of Associate Prof. Pavlos Efraimidis. Since November 2020, have been adjunct researcher at the Athena Research Center, specifically at the Language and Speech Processing institute. I have participated in 4 research projects (Phasma Food, PROMOTE, AGRO4+, SUSANNA), focusing on data security using decentralized technologies. My research interests included blockchain research (Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric), tokens, development of decentralized application (DApps), efficient computation, and privacy in the blockchain. I have contributed to the authorship of over eight European and Greek proposals.
